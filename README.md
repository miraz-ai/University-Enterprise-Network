University Enterprise Network Design

This project represents the internal network architecture of a university. The design is divided into several key zones — Core Infrastructure, Access, and Department Operations — to ensure scalability and efficient management.

The network connects 20+ hosts through multiple routers and switches, implementing both dynamic and static routing for optimal performance:

DHCP automates IP address allocation across subnets.

RIP (Routing Information Protocol) enables dynamic router-to-router communication.

Static routing is applied for server connectivity to maintain consistent and secure access.

The overall design ensures seamless communication, reliability, and structured segmentation across all zones of the enterprise network.
